        <p>My name is Kazuma Meraz and I am a student at Emerald Highschool in Dublin, California. I am interested in making new friends and interested in coding.
        <p> </p>
        <p> I am hardworking and I am flexible working with others and I like creativity and teamwork. My biggest challenges are getting to know new people.
        <p></p>
        <p> I am currently in no clubs.
        <p></p>
        <p> I play baseball and I also run track and it has made me who I am today. The problems I have faces were understanding the game but I was always looking forward to the next play!
